## Weather_Database:
Generated a set of 687 random latitudes and longitudes in [Weather_Database.ipynb](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb), retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data used API to retrieve the current weather description for each city ([WeatherPy_Database.csv](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)). Then, created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Vacation_Search:
Used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences in [Vacation_Search.ipynb](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb), then used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels in [WeatherPy_vacation.csv](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv). Then, showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Vacation Itinerary:
Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
