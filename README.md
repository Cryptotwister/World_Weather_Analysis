# World_Weather_Analysis
PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in a hotel and loging industry. Jack, head of analysis for the user interface team, asked to help him collect and present data for customers via the search page which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteris in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in a world.

At the most fundamental level, Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

outline of your project plan:

Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

Your analysis of the data will be split into three main parts, or stages.
