# World_Weather_Analysis
PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in a hotel and loging industry. We were asked to help collect and present data for customers via the search page which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteris in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in a world.

Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

## Weather_Database:
Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Vacation_Search:
Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Vacation Itinerary:
Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
